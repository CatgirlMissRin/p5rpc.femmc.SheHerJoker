All of these are sometimes not changed if the context makes more sense without it changed. Regardless do tell me ones you find that feel wrong and I will see if I need to fix them or if I intentially left them.
A mild guide for how I replaced each word, even then there are times where I use something else even if I do not say it here when it fits better. For example, when Sojiro says he does not allow men in his passanger seat, I changed it to say children.
