# p5rpc.femmc.SheHerJoker
GameBanana page, the releases on this site are the same as the ones under Releases here; https://gamebanana.com/mods/426328

Tired of having your immersion broken of the self-insert protag when other pronouns are used for Joker? Just want to experience different pronouns? This mod is hopefully for you!

THERE IS A HIGH POSSIBILITY I MESSED UP SOME TEXT FILE SOMEWHERE AND IT MAY CRASH THE GAME, SAVE OFTEN.

This mod aims to change every single gendered term that refers to Joker with either feminine terms or gender-neutral terms if it makes more sense for the context. A few terms were not changed a majority of the time, like dude or man as those are more often not specifically gendering Joker and is just how a character acts. If you want to, you can do text editing yourself and change them.

Since this specific mod only changes text, no other possibly gendering thing is changed. The bathhouse is not any different, the school bathrooms are unchanged (although in the future I may release an update or another mod to allow Joker to enter either bathroom or just simply swap the textures). Anime cutscene subtitles have not been changed as I have not been able to find out how to change them. There are absolutely no model or art swaps in this mod. No audio changes at all, I have an idea of some sentence mixing that I might attempt for the English dub, but no promises. Of course, there are no Japanese script changes, as I have a Japanese elementary schooler's knowledge of the language.

This just, took a good while and a lot of going through the script, so obviously there will still be remnants that I just missed because of how huge this game is, as well as times where I accidentally changed a term incorrectly and typos...and crashes due to AtlusScriptCompiler being funky and needing to recompile .bf and .bmd files that cause crashes in PersonaEditor instead, but I don't know which ones I need to do that for unless you tell me or I stumble across it.

I really enjoyed doing this mod and I will probably do a few more things in the future of unrelated mods, but possibly work on a full FemMC project that replaces even more, but this seems like it was the large brunt of the work, now that it's done others could also create their own FemMC projects and not have to worry about the hundred or so hours needed to edit the script for every single instance.

This mod will completely conflict with other mods that change any .bmd or .bf files that are also changed by my mod
If you are more concerned about pronouns than any cheat sheet mod, no romance mods, etc, make this one have a higher priority (in Reloaded II that means putting it at the BOTTOM of the mod list). I am planning on eventually contacting the creators of popular mods that conflict a whole lot to see if they'd be fine with me making a patch that merges together the mods. Or also just waiting for mod merging.

How To Submit Errors/Unchanged Text
Again, I've obviously missed some areas of text, accidentally changed the wrong text, or made a typo. The best way to submit these are to include a screenshot, and context of where in the game this is for the highest chance of me being able to fix it. Crashes are also very likely, while video clips would be the best, follow the same thing of context before the crash, where you are, what day, main story or is it an event? ect. ect.

If you do not have this mod as the highest priority (bottom of the list) then when submitting missed words or crashes TELL ME WHAT OTHER MODS HAVE HIGHER PRIORITY because that may be the issue.

The BEST place is the GitHub issues page for this mod as it allows for a bit more orginization.
GameBanana issue page, if you need to comment instead, fine, but the issue page is more useful.

Known Issues
Typos/missed words/incorrect words will not get an immediate update to reduce on spamming updates, any crash fixes will be pushed instantly along with everything else waiting to be updated. If you do want the cutting edge version you can download the "code" .zip off of the GitHub page (the Releases page are the same releases as here). 

Some interstitials of city talk in-between scenes are not changed (when referring to the true ending twists), probably just a missed file.
Crashes are possible and probable, PLEASE REPORT CRASHES THE SECOND YOU GET THEM, I WILL REPAIR THEM ASAP
Subject line of texts, ex: a Futaba text that says "Hey boyfriend. Christmas eve"
Anime cutscene subtitles are not changed. Not sure on how...someone said its baked into the exe which would suck.
Item descriptions are not changed, in progress.
School bathrooms are COMPLETELY UNCHANGED, no text is changed either. I have plans for a larger update that either just swaps the textures or allows you to go into both bathrooms.

Installation Guide
Look you should know how to install mods, follow the tutorials on GameBanana, FOR this mod, if you find these gendered word replacements more important then, with ANY TYPE OF TEXT MOD (cheat sheets, descriptions, ect ect.) it MUST be the highest priority of text mods, in Reloaded II that means at the BOTTOM of the mod list. If you do not have this mod as the highest priority (bottom of the list) then when submitting missed words or crashes TELL ME WHAT OTHER MODS HAVE HIGHER PRIORITY because that may be the issue.
