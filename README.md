# p5rpc.femmc.SheHerJoker
Persona 5 Royal PC mod that replaces all gendered words referring to Joker with feminine or gender neutral words

This is the GitHub repository for this mod. It exists in place of the GameBanana mod page for me to quickly push minor changes too.
Think of this as the beta channel and GameBanana as the stable (although tbh this will be a bit more stable here).

Below is just the GameBanana Description

Tired of having your immersion broken of the self-insert protag when other pronouns are used for Joker? Just want to experience different pronouns? This mod is hopefully for you!

THERE IS A HIGH POSSIBILITY I MESSED UP SOME TEXT FILE SOMEWHERE AND IT MAY CRASH THE GAME, SAVE OFTEN.

This mod aims to change every single gendered term that refers to Joker with either feminine terms or gender-neutral terms if it makes more sense for the context. A few terms were not changed a majority of the time, like dude or man as those are more often not specifically gendering Joker and is just how a character acts. If you want to, you can do text editing yourself and change them.

Since this specific mod only changes text, no other possibly gendering thing is changed. The bathhouse is not any different, the school bathrooms are unchanged (although in the future I may release an update or another mod to allow Joker to enter either bathroom or just simply swap the textures). Anime cutscene subtitles have not been changed as I have not been able to find out how to change them. There are absolutely no model or art swaps in this mod. No audio changes at all, I have an idea of some sentence mixing that I might attempt for the English dub, but no promises. Of course, there are no Japanese script changes, as I have a Japanese elementary schooler's knowledge of the language.

This just, took a good while and a lot of going through the script, so obviously there will still be remnants that I just missed because of how huge this game is, as well as times where I accidentally changed a term incorrectly and typos.

I really enjoyed doing this mod and I will probably do a few more things in the future of unrelated mods, but possibly work on a full FemMC project that replaces everything else, but this seems like it was the large brunt of the work, now that it's done others could also create their own FemMC projects and not have to worry about the hundred or so hours needed to edit the script for every single instance.

This mod will completely conflict with other mods that change any .bmd or .bf files that are also changed by my mod. 
If you are more concerned about pronouns than any cheat sheet mod, no romance mods, etc, make this one have a higher priority (in Reloaded II that means putting it at the BOTTOM of the mod list). I am planning on eventually contacting the creators of popular mods that conflict a whole lot to see if they'd be fine with me making a patch that merges together the mods.

How To Submit Errors/Unchanged Text
Again, I've obviously missed some areas of text, accidentally changed the wrong text, or made a typo. The best way to submit these are to include a screenshot, and context of where in the game this is for the highest chance of me being able to fix it.

Known Issues
Typos/missed words/incorrect words will not get an immediate update to reduce on spamming updates, any crash fixes will be pushed instantly along with everything else waiting to be updated.

Some interstitials of city talk in-between scenes are not changed, not entirely sure why, possibly just didn't change it, will figure out later.
NPC chatter may crash the game, I think I have fixed most of them, but if not, tell me what city you were in when a crash occurred. (Video clips appreciated)
Subject line of texts, ex: a Futaba text that says "Hey boyfriend. Christmas eve"
Anime cutscene subtitles are not changed. Not sure on how...
Item descriptions are not changed, in progress.
